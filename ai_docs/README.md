# CRM Service AI Documentation

Complete development documentation for AI assistants working on this CRM service project.

## 📋 Quick Start

**ALWAYS read these first:**
1. [Critical Rules](critical-rules.md) - **MUST READ** before any task
2. [Architecture](architecture.md) - Understand DDD and Hexagonal Architecture

## 📚 Documentation Index

### Core Architecture
- **[Critical Rules](critical-rules.md)** ⚠️ - Database Performance, CQRS, Laravel Resources (READ FIRST)
- **[Architecture](architecture.md)** - DDD, Hexagonal Architecture, Bounded Contexts
- **[Code Quality](code-quality.md)** - SOLID Principles, Naming Conventions, Best Practices

### Application Layer (CQRS)
- **[Application Layer](application-layer.md)** - Queries, Commands, Events, Process Managers

### Infrastructure
- **[Infrastructure](infrastructure.md)** - Repositories, Tables, Entities, Hydrators

## 🎯 Quick Reference by Task

## 🚀 Development Environment

- **PHP 8.4**
- **Laravel 12** - Modern framework
- **Docker** - All code runs in Docker (never execute on host)
- **MySQL** - Large database (always consider performance)
- **DDD + Hexagonal Architecture** - Framework-agnostic domain in /src
